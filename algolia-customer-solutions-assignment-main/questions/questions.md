Hello Marissa,

Thank you for your feedback! We understand that quick access to clearing and deleting indexes is important for your workflow. We are always working to improve the dashboard experience and will share your input with our product team. In the meantime, you can use the Algolia API or CLI to manage indexes more efficiently during development. If you need guidance on this, let us know!

Best regards,
The Algolia Team

*Question 2*:   

From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  

Hi Carrie,

The error "Record is too big" means that one or more of your records exceeds Algolia's size limit (100KB per record). To resolve this, please remove any non-searchable metadata or move large data fields outside of the record sent to Algolia. Only include attributes needed for search and display. If you need to store extra data, consider referencing it by ID or storing it elsewhere. Let us know if you need help identifying large fields!

Best,
The Algolia Team
